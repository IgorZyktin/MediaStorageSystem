        <p>You can use logical keywords to perform search.
            Words are: AND, OR and NOT.
            Exactly uppercase. Search is not working for spelling mistakes.
            Your request must match tags exactly. Anything except keywords
            is converted to lowercase during processing.</p>

        <p>Meanings are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AND - record is included in search results only if text after
                this
                keyword is present in at least one tag. If not - record is not
                included, no matter what all the rest conditions say.
            </li>

            <li>OR - record is included in search results if text after
                this keyword is present in at least one tag, but it is not
                final decision. Some other condition may add record to the
                results.
            </li>

            <li>NOT - record is excluded from the search results if text after
                this keyword is found in any tag.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Query will be split into series of pairs keyword+text.
            If your request does not start from keyword, system with
            automatically
            add OR at the start. So "cats AND dogs NOT frogs" will be turned
            into "OR cats AND dogs NOT frogs". As a result, human readable form
            of this request is: "show me all records, that specifically have
            tag 'dogs' and optionally have tag 'cats', but definitely do
            not have tag 'frogs'".</p>

        <p>Don't think of query as of logical rule. Each keyword is treated
            separately. You cannot use queries like "cats AND NOT dogs".</p>

        <p>You can use special keywords to perform search.
            Exactly uppercase.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>TINY - only tiny images</li>
            <li>SMALL - only small images</li>
            <li>MEAN - only regular size images</li>
            <li>BIG - only big images</li>
            <li>HUGE - only huge images</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For video/audion or animated images:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>MOMENT - only super short duration</li>
            <li>SHORT - only short duration</li>
            <li>MEDIUM - only medium length duration</li>
            <li>LONG - only long duration</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For specific media type:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>VIDEO - only video files</li>
            <li>AUDIO - only audio files</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Other:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>DESC - show found records in reverse order</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For example: bgc AND SHORT AND DESC</p>
        <p>Logical keywords do not matter here, AND will be always used.</p>
