    {#-----------------------------------------------------------------------#}

    <div class="text_zone">
        <p>You can use logical keywords to perform search, such as: AND, OR and
            NOT. Exactly uppercase. Search is not working for spelling
            mistakes. Your request must match tag exactly. Anything, except
            keywords, is converted to lowercase during processing.</p>

        <p>Meanings are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AND - record is included only if
                text is present in at least one tag.
            </li>

            <li>OR - record is included if text is present,
                but other keywords might change it.
            </li>

            <li>NOT - record is excluded from the search results if text after
                this keyword is found in any tag.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Query will be split into series of pairs keyword+text. If your
            request does not start from keyword, system will automatically add
            AND at the start. So "cats AND dogs NOT frogs" will be turned into
            "AND cats AND dogs NOT frogs". As a result, human readable form of
            this request is: "show me all records, that specifically have tag
            'dogs' and optionally have tag 'cats', but definitely do
            not have tag 'frogs'".</p>

        <p>Do not think of the query as of logical rule. Each keyword is
            treated separately. You cannot use queries like
            "cats AND NOT dogs".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="zone"><h1>Themes</h1></div>
    {#-----------------------------------------------------------------------#}

    <div class="text_zone">
        <p>Themes are constructed from folders in base folder.
            Each "theme" is representing some, well, theme and makes it
            possible to distinguish between them. Once you got inside theme,
            system will try to keep you inside. You can change themes on the
            Tags tab. You also can use keywords to alter search results without
            actually changing your current theme.</p>

        <p>Meanings are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>INCLUDE - record is included only if its theme
                is the same as in user request.
            </li>

            <li>EXCLUDE - record is excluded if its theme
                is the same as in user request.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that themes are separate from tags.
            Even if they have the same name, search will be performed
            separately. You also cas use these keywords multiple times.</p>
        <p><strong>Currently you need to specify directory name, not actually
            theme name.</strong></p>

    <div class="zone"><h1>Keywords</h1></div>

    <div class="text_zone">
        <p>You can use special keywords to perform search.
            Exactly uppercase.</p>

        <p>For images:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>TINY - only tiny images</li>
            <li>SMALL - only small images</li>
            <li>MEAN - only regular size images</li>
            <li>BIG - only big images</li>
            <li>HUGE - only huge images</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For video/audion or animated images:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>MOMENT - only super short duration</li>
            <li>SHORT - only short duration</li>
            <li>MEDIUM - only medium length duration</li>
            <li>LONG - only long duration</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For specific media type:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>IMAGE - only static images</li>
            <li>GIF - only animated images</li>
            <li>VIDEO - only video files</li>
            <li>AUDIO - only audio files</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Other:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>DESC - show found records in reverse order</li>
            <li>DEMAND - force showing hidden tags</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For example: bgc AND SHORT AND DESC</p>
        <p>Logical keywords do not matter here, AND will always be used.</p>
