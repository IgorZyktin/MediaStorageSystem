    <div class="text_zone">
        <p>You can use logical keywords to perform search.
            Words are: AND, OR and NOT.
            Exactly uppercase. Search is not working for spelling mistakes.
            Your request must match tags exactly. Anything except keywords
            is converted to lowercase during processing.</p>

        <p>Meanings are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AND - record is included in search results only if text after
                this
                keyword is present in at least one tag. If not - record is not
                included, no matter what all the rest conditions say.
            </li>

            <li>OR - record is included in search results if text after
                this keyword is present in at least one tag, but it is not
                final decision. Some other condition may add record to the
                results.
            </li>

            <li>NOT - record is excluded from the search results if text after
                this keyword is found in any tag.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Query will be split into series of pairs keyword+text.
            If your request does not start from keyword, system with
            automatically
            add OR at the start. So "cats AND dogs NOT frogs" will be turned
            into "OR cats AND dogs NOT frogs". As a result, human readable form
            of this request is: "show me all records, that specifically have
            tag 'dogs' and optionally have tag 'cats', but definitely do
            not have tag 'frogs'".</p>

        <p>Don't think of query as of logical rule. Each keyword is treated
            separately. You cannot use queries like "cats AND NOT dogs".</p>

    {#-----------------------------------------------------------------------#}

    <div class="text_zone">
        <p>Themes are constructed from folders in base folder.
            Each theme is representing some, well, theme and makes it possible
            to
            distinguish between them. Once you got inside theme, system will
            try to keep
            you inside. You can change themes on the Tags tab. You also can use
            keywords to alter search results without actually changing your
            current theme.</p>

        <p>Meanings are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ONLY - record is included only if its theme
                is the same as in user request.
            </li>

            <li>EXCEPT - record is excluded if its theme
                is the same as in user request.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that themes are separate from tags. Even if they have the same
            name, search will be performed separately.</p>
        <p><strong>Currently you need to specify directory name, not actually
            theme name.</strong></p>

    <div class="zone"><h1>Keywords</h1></div>

                being specifically noted
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>For example: bgc AND SHORT AND DESC</p>
        <p>Logical keywords do not matter here, AND will be always used.</p>
